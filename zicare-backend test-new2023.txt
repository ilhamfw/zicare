Soal Test terdiri dari 2 bagian yaitu technical test dan logical test!
Technical(membuat api)

1. Design Schema for the following:
List of Patients, each patient can do a reservation for a consultation, the reservation is based on the clinic slot/schedule
patient will get the queueing number

2. Architecture Test:
using python with Fastapi framework.
Based on your schema, write CRUD APIs for the patient reservation case

You can either submit
the Github link or zip folder. Write any assumptions that you have in README.md

Some things that we’d like to see on the project
● explanation of your project structure or design pattern that you implement
● Short manual to run the application (+ with docker, a must if you are not using python with fastapi framework)
● API documentation. You can choose any format you like
including README.md


Algorithm
2. Find a number sequence inside an array of numbers
Int [] main = new int[] {20, 7, 8, 10, 2, 5, 6} // non repeating numbers
Int [] seq= new int [] {1,4}
sequenceExists(main, [7,8]) ⇒ true
sequenceExists(main, [8, 7]) ⇒ false
sequenceExists(main, [7, 10]) ⇒ false

for this, you can use any languages you’re comfortable
